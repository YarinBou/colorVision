HackIDC 2021 - Tambour Challenge.
Challenge of reality to RGB code:
Last April, 36% of referrals to Tambour's specialist center wanted help in identifying what shade was in the picture they sent.
There are quite a few parameters that affect how human eye perceives the hue and interprets it.
The purpose of the challenge is to neutralize the environmental impact and try to isolate the RGB code using a technological interface so that the user will get the closest hue to the RGB of the Tambour fan.
Using your infrastructure, Tambour will be able to develop quite a few new business models that will help us take a few more steps forward.
